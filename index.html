      <div class="about-line"></div>
      <div class="col">
        <p>I am a passionate product designer with a strong foundation in user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design, driven by a commitment to crafting intuitive and impactful digital products. With a background in Information Science (Informatics) and advanced training in product design through Moringa School’s collaborative bootcamp with Flatiron School, I bring a blend of technical expertise, creativity, and strategic thinking to every project I undertake.        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
          <p>My design philosophy revolves around empathy and innovation. I strive to deeply understand user needs, behaviors, and challenges to deliver solutions that are not only functional but also delightful to use. Whether it's designing a platform for government spending transparency, creating an engaging meme-sharing app, or simplifying the decision-making process for parents choosing schools, I approach every project with a focus on creating value for both users and stakeholders.

Key strengths include:

User-Centered Design: Skilled in research, prototyping, and usability testing to ensure designs meet real-world needs.
Problem-Solving: Adept at synthesizing insights from data and user feedback into actionable design solutions.
Collaboration: Experienced in working with cross-functional teams, including developers, researchers, and stakeholders.
Tool Proficiency: Proficient in Figma, Adobe Creative Suite, Miro, and other industry-standard tools for creating polished, impactful designs.
Beyond technical skills, I am a lifelong learner and advocate for design inclusivity and sustainability. I believe that great design has the power to drive positive change, and I am committed to leveraging my skills to create products that are not only beautiful but also meaningful.

When I’m not designing, you’ll find me exploring new design trends, mentoring aspiring designers, or contributing to community initiatives aimed at empowering the next generation of innovators.

Let’s create something amazing together!

          <h4>Public Revenue Tracker (PRT): Enhancing Government Transparency</h4>
          <p>The Public Revenue Tracker (PRT) is a platform designed to address the lack of transparency in government spending. Citizens struggle to access clear, up-to-date information about how tax money is spent, leading to mistrust and limited accountability. My team developed a user-friendly dashboard that empowers citizens to track government expenditures, monitor project progress, and provide feedback.          </p>
